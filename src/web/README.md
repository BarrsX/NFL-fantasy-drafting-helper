- Data files in the `data/` directory

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/overall` - Overall player rankings

- `GET /api/draft_board` - Draft board data
- `POST /api/update_drafted` - Update drafted status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Import could not be resolved" errors**:

   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Dashboard won't start**:

   - Check that all data files exist in the `data/` directory
   - Verify configuration file paths are correct

3. **No data displayed**:

   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the Flask server is running on port 5000

4. **Styling issues**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check that Bootstrap CDN is accessible

### Data Requirements

The dashboard requires the same data files as the Excel output:

- `data/sleeper_adp.csv` - ADP data
- `data/offense_projections.csv` - Projection data
- `data/idp_projections.csv` - IDP data (optional)
