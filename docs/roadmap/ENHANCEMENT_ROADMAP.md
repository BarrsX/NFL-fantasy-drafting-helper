# Fantasy Draft Tool Enhancement Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

Your tool currently provides:

- ✅ Static CSV-based projections
- ✅ Basic Sleeper ADP integration
- ✅ Excel export with formatting
- ✅ Custom scoring configurations
- ✅ Multi-source consensus projections

## Phase 1: Core API Integrations (High Impact, Medium Effort)

### 1. NFL Data Integration

**Library:** `nfl-data-py`
**Benefits:** Historical data, play-by-play stats, advanced metrics

```python
# Add to requirements.txt
nfl-data-py

# Usage examples:
import nfl_data_py as nfl

# Get weekly data with advanced metrics
weekly_data = nfl.import_weekly_data([2024])

# Get PBP data for advanced analytics
pbp_data = nfl.import_pbp_data([2024])

# Get roster changes
rosters = nfl.import_rosters([2024])
```

### 2. ESPN API Integration

**Benefits:** Live stats, injury reports, depth charts

```python
# Free ESPN APIs available:
- https://site.api.espn.com/apis/fantasy/v2/games/ffl/news/injuries
- https://site.api.espn.com/apis/fantasy/v2/games/ffl/players
- https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{season}/segments/0/leagues
```

### 3. FantasyPros API

**Benefits:** Expert projections, rankings

```python
# REST API access to:
- Position rankings
- Weekly projections
- Dynasty values
- Injury reports
```

## Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (High Impact, High Effort)

### 1. Machine Learning Projections

**Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

```python
# Features to implement:
- Player similarity algorithms
- Injury prediction models
- Performance trend analysis
- Weather impact modeling
```

### 2. Real-time Draft Features

**Libraries:** `websockets`, `flask-socketio`

```python
# Live features:
- Real-time ADP updates
- Draft pick recommendations
- Trade value calculator
- Live draft board updates
```

### 3. Advanced Metrics Integration

**Data Sources:**

- Football Outsiders (DVOA, DYAR)
- Pro Football Focus (PFF grades)
- Sports Info Solutions (efficiency metrics)

## Phase 3: User Experience (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

### 1. Web Interface

**Libraries:** `flask`, `plotly`, `dash`

```python
# Features:
- Interactive draft board
- Real-time projections
- Visual analytics dashboard
- Mobile-responsive design
```

### 2. Automated Reporting

**Libraries:** `schedule`, `smtplib`

```python
# Features:
- Daily projection updates
- Email alerts for significant changes
- Automated cheat sheet generation
- Slack/Discord integration
```

## Phase 4: Data Quality & Reliability (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Data Validation Pipeline

```python
# Implement:
- Outlier detection
- Source reliability scoring
- Historical accuracy tracking
- Confidence intervals
```

### 2. Caching & Performance

**Libraries:** `redis`, `joblib`

```python
# Features:
- API response caching
- Parallel data fetching
- Background data updates
- Memory optimization
```

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks):

1. Install `nfl-data-py` and integrate basic NFL data
2. Add ESPN injury API
3. Implement data caching

### Short-term (1-3 months):

1. FantasyPros API integration
2. Basic ML projection model
3. Web dashboard prototype

### Long-term (3-6 months):

1. Real-time draft features
2. Advanced analytics dashboard
3. Mobile app development

## Quick Wins (Can implement today):

1. **Add Weather Data:**

```python
# Free OpenWeatherMap API
# Adjust projections based on game conditions
```

2. **Injury Impact Analysis:**

```python
# Correlate injury status with projection changes
```

3. **Automated Updates:**

```python
# Schedule daily data refreshes
```

Would you like me to start implementing any of these specific enhancements?
