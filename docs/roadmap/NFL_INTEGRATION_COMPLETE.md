## üöÄ **How to Use It**

### **1. Basic NFL Data Access**

```python
from scripts.core.nfl_data_integration import NFLDataIntegrator

nfl = NFLDataIntegrator()

# Get weekly player data
weekly_data = nfl.get_weekly_data([2024])

# Get advanced position analysis
qb_stats = nfl.get_position_stats('QB', [2024])

# Export comprehensive summary
nfl.export_data_summary("nfl_analysis.xlsx")
```

### **2. Enhanced Fantasy Projections**

```python
from scripts.core.enhanced_fantasy_tool import EnhancedFantasyTool

tool = EnhancedFantasyTool()

# Enhance your existing projections
enhanced_projections = tool.enhance_projections_with_nfl_data(
    your_fantasy_projections,
    seasons_to_analyze=[2023, 2024]
)

# Generate enhanced Excel file
tool.generate_enhanced_cheatsheet(
    enhanced_projections,
    "enhanced_cheatsheet.xlsx"
)
```

### **3. Integration with Your Existing Tool**

```python
# In your sleeper_cheatsheet.py, add:
from core.enhanced_fantasy_tool import EnhancedFantasyTool

# After loading your projections, enhance them:
enhanced_tool = EnhancedFantasyTool()
enhanced_projections = enhanced_tool.enhance_projections_with_nfl_data(
    overall_df,  # Your existing projections
    seasons_to_analyze=[2024]
)

# The enhanced data includes new columns:
# - nfl_games_played
